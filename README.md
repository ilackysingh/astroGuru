# astroGuru


A mini UI Project based on Astrology SIte named AstroGuru created using bootstrap and figma.

The astrology UI project is designed to provide users with a comprehensive and user-friendly interface to connect with astrologers and access various astrology-related services. The UI includes the following features:

User Registration and Login: The UI allows users to create an account, log in, and manage their profile. Users can enter their personal information and create a username and password for future access.

Dashboard: Upon logging in, users will land on the dashboard where they can see all available services offered by the astrology platform.

Call and Chat with Astrologer: Users can connect with astrologers either via call or chat. This feature enables users to seek advice from astrologers, ask for predictions or recommendations.

Palm Reading: Users can take a photo of their palm and upload it to the platform. The astrologer can then read the palm and provide insights into the user's life, personality, and future.

Get in Touch: Users can get in touch with astrologers directly using the 'Get in Touch' feature. This feature enables users to ask any questions or seek advice from astrologers directly.

Reports: Users can request various astrology-related reports, such as birth charts, horoscopes, and compatibility reports.

Payment Integration: The UI integrates a payment gateway to enable users to pay for services provided by astrologers.

The backend of this project would require developing an API that connects the UI to the database and services. The API would handle user authentication, user data management, and integration with external services such as payment gateways. Additionally, the backend would also need to include services for palm reading, astrology reports, and communication with astrologers via call and chat.
